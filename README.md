# McGill-FIAM Asset Management Hackathon

This repository contains my work for the inaugural McGill-FIAM Asset Management Hackathon. The hackathon is an annual event designed to bridge the gap between Finance and Data Science. The challenge involves creating portfolio trading strategies using big data and machine learning (ML).

## Problem Statement

The problem statement for this case revolves around:

1. Finding machine learning (ML) methods that work well for building portfolios.
2. Identifying key financial factors that help pick better-performing stocks.
3. Choosing stocks and deciding how much to invest in each one to create an optimized portfolio and predict its future success.
4. Running a back-testâ€”this means checking how your portfolio would have performed in the past based on your stock picks.

Participants are encouraged to innovate further on the methodologies and their applications to portfolio management. They are also not limited to the data provided and are free to supplement this data with extra data they think can be useful.

## Second Stage

Based on the submissions, 10 teams will be selected to advance to the finals. In the second stage, they will receive further training, access to industry advisors and mentors who apply technology to asset management daily, insights from leaders in the field, and additional financial data science training.

## Final Objective

The objective of the final hack is to bring the research experience gained in the first stage as close as possible to real-life implementation. The participants are not expected to deliver AI-transformative solutions for portfolio management in such a short time. Instead, they are expected to do their best and present their most promising idea, and its execution with the data provided. Their creativity in setting up the training and the methodology, and how they use the data will be important criteria for evaluation.
